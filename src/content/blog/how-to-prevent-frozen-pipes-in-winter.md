Winter in Norfolk can be harsh. With biting winds blowing in off the North Sea and temperatures regularly dropping below zero, frozen pipes are one of the most common plumbing problems we deal with between November and March. A burst pipe can cause thousands of pounds in water damage, so prevention is always better than cure.

Here is our complete guide to keeping your pipes safe this winter, with advice tailored to the conditions we face here in [Great Yarmouth](/areas/great-yarmouth/) and the surrounding Norfolk coast.

## Why Frozen Pipes Are Such a Risk in Norfolk

Great Yarmouth sits right on the coast, and coastal areas experience a unique combination of low temperatures and strong winds. Wind chill can make the effective temperature much lower than what the thermometer shows. That means exposed pipes, especially those in unheated spaces, are at serious risk.

Older properties in the borough are particularly vulnerable. Many homes in Gorleston, Caister, and the town centre were built long before modern insulation standards. Pipes running through lofts, garages, and exterior walls often have little or no protection against the cold.

When water inside a pipe freezes, it expands. This expansion puts enormous pressure on the pipe walls. Copper pipes, plastic pipes, and even modern push-fit joints can all fail under this pressure. The result is usually a split or crack that only becomes obvious once the ice thaws and water starts flowing again.

## 8 Practical Steps to Prevent Frozen Pipes

### 1. Insulate Your Pipes

Pipe lagging is cheap, easy to fit, and extremely effective. You can buy foam pipe insulation from any hardware shop for just a few pounds. Focus on pipes in the following areas:

- Loft spaces
- Garages and outbuildings
- Under the kitchen sink (especially if it sits on an outside wall)
- Anywhere pipes run through unheated rooms

Make sure there are no gaps in the lagging. Even a small exposed section can be enough for ice to form.

### 2. Keep Your Heating On (at Least a Little)

If you are going away during winter, never turn your heating off completely. Set your thermostat to at least 12 to 15 degrees Celsius. This keeps enough warmth circulating through the house to prevent pipes from reaching freezing point.

Many modern thermostats have a frost protection setting. If yours does, use it. This will kick the heating on automatically when the temperature drops too low.

### 3. Fix Dripping Taps

A dripping tap might seem harmless, but in freezing conditions the small amount of water trickling through the pipe can freeze and create a blockage. Getting dripping taps repaired before winter arrives is a simple way to reduce your risk.

### 4. Know Where Your Stopcock Is

If a pipe does burst, you need to shut off the water supply as quickly as possible. Your internal stopcock is usually located under the kitchen sink or in a downstairs cupboard. Make sure you can find it, reach it, and turn it. Test it now, before an emergency happens. Stopcocks that haven't been turned for years can seize up.

### 5. Open Loft Hatches on the Coldest Nights

On nights when temperatures are forecast to drop well below zero, leave your loft hatch slightly open. This allows a small amount of warm air from your home to rise into the loft and keep the temperature above freezing. It is a simple trick that can make a real difference.

### 6. Let Cold Air Out, Keep Warm Air In

Check for draughts around windows, doors, and anywhere pipes enter your home from outside. Seal any gaps with draught excluder or expanding foam. Cold air blowing directly onto a pipe is one of the fastest ways for ice to form.

### 7. Open Cabinet Doors Under Sinks

On very cold nights, open the cabinet doors under your kitchen and bathroom sinks. This allows warm air from the room to circulate around the pipes. It is especially important if the sink is mounted on an external wall.

### 8. Drain Outdoor Taps and Hoses

Disconnect any garden hoses before the first frost. If you have an isolation valve for your outdoor tap, turn it off and open the tap to drain any remaining water. Outdoor taps and the pipes feeding them are extremely vulnerable to freezing.

## What to Do If Your Pipes Freeze

If you turn on a tap and nothing comes out (or only a trickle), you likely have a frozen pipe. Here is what to do:

1. **Turn off the water at the stopcock.** This limits the damage if the pipe has already split.
2. **Open the affected tap.** As the ice melts, water needs somewhere to go.
3. **Warm the pipe gently.** Use a hairdryer, hot water bottle, or warm towels wrapped around the pipe. Start from the tap end and work backwards. Never use a blowtorch or naked flame.
4. **Check for damage.** Once the pipe thaws, inspect it carefully for cracks or splits. Even a small crack will leak once water pressure returns.

If you find a leak or cannot locate the frozen section, call us straight away on **01493 334000**. We offer [leak repair services](/services/leak-repair/) across Great Yarmouth and can respond quickly to minimise water damage.

## When Frozen Pipes Cause Bigger Problems

Sometimes a frozen pipe does not just crack. It can split wide open, especially in older copper pipework. When this happens, the damage can be severe. Ceilings can collapse from the weight of water. Floors, walls, and furniture can be ruined.

If your home has experienced significant pipe damage from freezing, you may need more than a simple repair. In some cases, [repiping](/services/repiping/) sections of your plumbing system is the most cost-effective long-term solution, particularly in older Norfolk properties where the existing pipework is already nearing the end of its life.

## Preparing Your Holiday Home or Rental Property

Many properties in Great Yarmouth and along the Norfolk coast are used as holiday lets or second homes. These properties are at the highest risk during winter because they often sit empty for weeks at a time with no heating running.

If you own a holiday property, consider these extra precautions:

- Install a smart thermostat so you can monitor and control the heating remotely
- Ask a neighbour or property manager to check the property regularly during cold spells
- Consider draining the water system entirely if the property will be empty for the whole winter
- Make sure your buildings insurance covers burst pipe damage (check the policy wording carefully)
