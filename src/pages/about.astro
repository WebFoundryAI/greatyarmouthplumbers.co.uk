          <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
            {business.name} was founded in {business.yearEstablished} by {business.owner} with a simple goal: to provide Great Yarmouth and the surrounding Norfolk area with plumbing services that people can trust. Over the past {years} years, we have grown from a one-person operation into a respected local company.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
            We started because we saw a need for plumbers who actually turn up on time, explain the problem in plain English, and charge a fair price. That is still what drives us today. Every member of our team shares these values, and we work hard to live up to them on every single job.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
            Today, we serve {serviceAreas.length} towns and villages across Norfolk and Suffolk, handling everything from emergency call-outs to complete bathroom installations. We are proud to be a part of this community, and we are grateful for the trust our customers place in us.
